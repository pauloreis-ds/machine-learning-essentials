# Machine Learning Essentials

Welcome to **Machine Learning Essentials**! This project was created to serve as a practical and theoretical reference material on key Machine Learning concepts and algorithms. The goal is to facilitate frequent reviews and provide a solid foundation for real-world applications.

## Main Objectives
1. Recall fundamental concepts of Machine Learning.
2. Create practical and theoretical material for regular reviews.
3. Bridge the gap between theory and practice in real-world projects.

## Material Structure

### 1. Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Basic definitions
- Types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)

### 2. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering Techniques
- To do

### 3. Key Algorithms
### Supervised
##### Tree Models
- Decision Tree
- Random Forests
- Ada Boost
- Gradient Boost
- XGBoost
- LightGBM



### Unsupervised
- K-Means

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Classification Metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, etc...)
- Regression Metrics (MAE, MAPE, RMSE...)
- Cross-validation techniques
- Overfitting and underfitting

### 5. Practical Applications
- Real-world business problem case studies
- End-to-end pipelines (EDA → Modeling → Evaluation → Explainability)

### 6. References and Further Reading
- Recommended books
- Academic articles
- Relevant GitHub repositories
